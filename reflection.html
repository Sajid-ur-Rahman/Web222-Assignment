            <p>  Responsive design means adjust the contents according to different screen sizes. These contents can be anything, for example, software, video, game, webpage etc.
                 Whatever screen size is used, the content should adapt the environment and run without causing any error.</p> <br>
            <p>  Responsive design is highly used in web technologies. In real world, there are many kinds of devices with different screen sizes.
                 From 100px to 1000px or more, any size is possible. Now, when a web designer is designing their website, they have to make sure that their website runs smoothly in every device. 
                 Because we don't know what user will use to browse a website. A user may use mobile phone, laptop, tab etc.
                 Whatever, device a user use, they should be able to browse the website without any difficulty. 
                 To accommodate this facility, almost every website today use responsive design.</p>     <br>
            <p>From my course I have learned that, I can build responsive website using <span class="yellow">@media</span> rule of CSS. 
                We just have to specify the maximum and minimum length of a targeted screen, and then have to specify how will the webpage behave within this range.
                 For example, <br> <br> <span class="yellow"> @media (min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1300px) <br> { <br>
                   &nbsp; p{
                   color:yellow;}
                  <br> } </span> <br> <br> 
                   This @media rule is targeted for typical laptop's screen or any device screen that falls within this range.
                    For simplicity, I have specified the color of all the p tag to be yellow. 
                    If user opens my webpage using his/her laptop, he will see all the p tag in yellow. <br> <br>
                   <span class="yellow"> @media (min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 799.98px) <br>
                    { <br>
                       &nbsp; p{
                        color:red;}
                        <br> } </span> <br><br>
                        This <span class="yellow">@media</span> rule is targeted for typical smartphone's screen or any device screen that falls within this range. 
                        If user opens my webpage using his/her smartphone, he will see all the p tag in red. <br>
                        This is just a basic demonstration of responsive design in web technologies.</p>     <br>
                <p>My learning experience was pretty much good in this course. I had interest in web developing prior to attend Seneca. 
                    This course even further enhanced my interest in Web developing. The best part of this course was JavaScript. 
                    JavaScript is so flexible.I can do literally everything with JavaScript using few lines of code. 
                    Compare to C++ or C, JavaScript  is nothing and I like this language than those two. I remember, In DCF course I was asked  to solve a problem. 
                    I just used JavaScript and didn't even bother to look for the solution in C or C++. 
                    In a nutshell, this course made me want to learn more about JavaScript, and hopefully I will pursue a JavaScript related career in the future.
